## Description

This goal of this paper is to analyze the benefit of off- and online mechanism design approaches to coordinate the charging stations allocations of electric vehicle drivers accross multiple navigation service platforms.

The folder `/data` contains the input data used for the experimental study described in the *Experimental Design* section, while the folder `/results` contains the data that served for the *Results* section..
